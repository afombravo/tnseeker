# Tnseeker
Tnseeker is an advanced pipeline tailored for transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-Seq) analysis. 

It performs an array of tasks: 
1. Read trimming based on the presence of transposon sequences & extraction of associated linked barcodes
2. Alignment to reference genome (bowtie2)
3. Links genomic locations (using .gff or .gb files as input) with transposon insertion locations
4. Infer essential genes based on global and local (contig wise) transposon insertion densities

What truly distinguishes Tnseeker from other tools is its unique capability to automatically infer and adjust threshold/cutoff parameters. This negates the need for intricate user input, allowing for a more precise determination of gene essentiality based on the data. 

Tnseeker is also compatible with any transposon disruption experiment. Be it Tn5, HIMAR, or anything else. Hence, Tnseeker is versatile enough to handle all Tn-Seq datasets.

Tnseeker is under active developement and is available as is. Contact me if you are interested in using the program or have any questions. Bugs can be expected. Please report any weird or unintented behaviour. 

## Instalation
There are two ways of installing tnseeker:


### 1. Recommended installation (using singularity)
1.  Install singularity in your system 

```
conda create -n singularity -c conda-forge singularity -y
```

2.  Active the conda environment
```
conda activate singularity
```

3.  Download the docker image from dockerhub. This will write a singularity container named `tnseeker_latest.sif` into your current work directory.
```bash
singularity pull docker://afombravo/tnseeker:latest
```

4. Start an interactive session of the container. Importantly, you need to `--bind` all the input files. It is easiest if you put all input files into a single folder, as this is how `tnseeker` expects it's input. The results will be written into the same folder.
Note: the `:rw` at the end of the path is crucial for singularity to obtain read/write permission and hence be able to compute.
```
singularity shell --bind /path/to/folder/containing/all/input/files:/input_files:rw \
                  tnseeker_latest.sif
```

5. Start a `tnseeker` run, like so:

```
cd /input_files; 
tnseeker \
  --cpu 4 \
  -s ORGANISM_FASTA/GB/GFF_NAME \
  -sd .  \
  -ad .  \
  -at gff \
  -st SE \
  --tn TN_SEQUENCE (ex: AGATTA) \ 
  --m 6 \
  --b \
  --b1 UPSTREAM_BARCODE_SEQUENCE (ex: AGAGA) \
  --b2 DOWNSTREAM_BARCODE_SEQUENCE (ex: ATATAT) \
  --ph 10 \
  --mq 20 \
  --b1m 3 \
  --b2m 3 \
  --ig 100 
```
When using HPC systems it is advisable to include the `--cpu` flag and specify the amount of threads.

### 2. Recommended installation #2 (using docker)
1.  Install docker in your system
2.  Download the docker image from dockerhub
```bash
docker pull afombravo/tnseeker:latest
```

3.  Rename to just tnseeker
```bash
docker tag afombravo/tnseeker:latest tnseeker
```

Alternatively, download the docker file from this repo and build it yourself.
```bash
docker build --no-cache -t tnseeker .
```

4.  Start tnseeker docker image with the comand:
```bash
docker run -it -v "<local_path/to/all/your/data>:/data" tnseeker
```

5.  Start tnseeker with:
```bash
tnseeker -sd ./ -ad ./ <ALL OTHER TNSEEKER COMANDS HERE>
```

NOTE: all files required by tnseeker, such as .fasta, .fastq, .gb, or .gff, need to be in the local folder indicated in 4. You then can use the -sd and -ad flags as indicated here in 5.


---
### 3. Alternative installation
The tnseeker pipeline requires Python3, Bowtie2, and BLAST, to be callable from the terminal (and added to path). 

#### For local BLAST
```bash
apt update
apt install ncbi-blast+
```

#### For bowtie2
```bash
apt install bowtie2
```

#### PyPI module
tnseeker can be installed as PyPI module with the folowing:
```bash
pip install tnseeker
```

tnseeker is executable from the command line by typing:

```bash
tnseeker
```

---
## Running Tnseeker

Tnseeker also has a test mode, where the blast, Bowtie2 instalations are tested, and a small run on a test dataset is performed.

```bash
tnseeker --tst
```

An example use case is the folowing. See below the meaning of the input arguments:

```bash
tnseeker -s BW25113 -sd ./ -ad ./ -at gb -st SE --tn AGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG --ph 10 --mq 40
```


### File requirements

tnseeker requires several input files:

 1. A '.fastq.gz' file (needs to be .gz)
 
 2. An annotation file in genbank format (.gb), or a .gff (there is an example gff format file in this repo)
 
 3. A FASTA file with the genome under analysis.

               names

## Python Dependencies

tnseeker requires several dependencies, all automatically instalable
A notable exception is the poibin module, which is available in the current tnseeker folder (you as the user don't need to do anything else), and can be originally be found here: https://github.com/tsakim/poibin


---
### Working modes

tnseeker is composed of 2 submodules: 

1. the initial sequencing processing: Handles the read trimming and alignment, creating a compiled .csv with all found transposon insertions. When individual transposon read associated barcodes are present, these are also extracted.

2. The Essential_finder: Infers gene essentiality from the insertion information found in the previous .csv file. tnseeker can thus be run on a standalone mode if the appropriate .csv and annotation files are indicated.
